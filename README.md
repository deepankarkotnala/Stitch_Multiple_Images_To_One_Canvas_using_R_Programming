# Stitch multiple images to one canvas using R Programming

This code will get all the pages from a pdf and save each page as an image in a directory. 
After converting each page into an image, the code will stitch all these images to a single canvas.

The image below is a compressed image. The actual image is larger in size so that the readability of each small image is maintained.
